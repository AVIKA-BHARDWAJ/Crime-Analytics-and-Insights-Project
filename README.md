#Crime Analytics and Insights 

A data analysis and visualization project focused on understanding crime patterns and trends using real-world crime data. 
This project uses **Power BI** for interactive dashboarding and **Python (Colab)** for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

The Power BI dashboard includes:
- Summary metrics (Total Cases, YoY Changes)
- Category-wise bar charts (e.g., Theft, Assault, Murder)
- Pie charts and Geographic Distribution of Crime Reports.

The dashboard provides quick insights and supports decision-making for law enforcement agencies and policymakers.
